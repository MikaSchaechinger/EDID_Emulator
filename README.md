The Adapter is connected between a HDMI/DVI source and a Display replaces the EDID and Hotplug Detect of the Display.

Use cases:

Keeping monitors connected to a PC while switching between different PCs with an inexpensive HDMI switch.
Controlling the display settings when using an HDMI splitter.
(Hopefully) use the HDMI Port of the TAng Nano 9k Dev board as a Input
Create and save multiple EDIDs over Serial Interface
Clone EDIDs of other Displays
Inspect and read out EDIDs over Serial Interface
 
It has a USB-C Connector to access the Serial Interface, and two HDMI Ports for Input and Output.

The PCB is a 6-Layer PCB, so the TMDS lines have enough shielding.
